# Linked List

The creation of a linked list for The Odin Project, beginning the first of a trilogy of computer science explorations which will cover linked lists, binary search trees and graphs.

Here, I created a Node and Linked List class to explore the concepts behind data handling, and to provide appreciation of the creation of the Array, String, Integer etc. classes in Ruby.
